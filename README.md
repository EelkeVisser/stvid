# STVID

**stvid** will be a set of *python* programs to detect and identify satellite tracks on video observations of the night sky, and measure the satellite positions to determine and/or update their orbits.

This software will take over the satellite tracking functionality of https://github.com/cbassa/sattools. By porting the functionality to *python*, the hope is that the software is easier to install and use.

This repository will primarily be used for development, and will rely, for the moment, on progams from the https://github.com/cbassa/sattools repository.
